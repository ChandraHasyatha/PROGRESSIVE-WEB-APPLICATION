Project Overview: PWA E-Commerce Platform-

This project aims to build a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an e-commerce platform that supports offline functionality and push notifications. The platform will allow users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and interact with the cart through a modal. Key features of the platform include:

Responsive Design:

The platform's layout adjusts automatically for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on all screen sizes.
Product Catalog:

The platform displays a list of products with their images, names, and prices. Each product can be added to the shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
Shopping Cart:

A modal popup displays the items in the user's cart, showing the products added. Users can view their cart and close the modal as needed.
Service Worker for Offline Support:

The service worker enables the platform to work offline by caching the necessary assets. This ensures that the app remains functional even when the internet connection is unavailable.
Push Notifications:

The app requests permission from the user to send push notifications, which can be used to alert users of important updates or promotions.
Technical Stack:
HTML: The structure of the website, including the product listing and cart modal.
CSS: Used for styling the website, ensuring that it is visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Implements interactivity such as adding products to the cart, managing the cart, and handling service worker registration for offline support.
Key Features:
Cart Functionality: Users can add products to the cart, and the cart count updates dynamically in the header.
Offline Mode: The app works offline using a service worker to cache assets for offline access.
Push Notifications: Users can receive notifications about updates or promotions using push notification capabilities.
Responsive Layout: The design adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Objective:
The goal is to create a user-friendly e-commerce experience that functions well even without an internet connection. By utilizing PWA technology, the app enhances the performance and usability of the platform, ensuring it is always accessible, fast, and engaging for users.
